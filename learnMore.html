        Hi! We are attendance. We have created an app for school students. We want this app to help reduce absenteeism in school. The app will be an aid for the students. At the same time, it will map out the well-being among the students and reasons why students do not show up at school or in individual lessons. Absenteeism in school is at a consistently high level, and we want a change to take place.

        <h2>How the app works</h2>
        <p>The app will be connected to the school's network. In this way, the app can register when a student enters the school area and into a classroom (the app will not be able to see where the students are when they leave the school area). If a student is not registered within the school area or in a classroom when school / class has started, he / she will receive a message from the app asking why they are not at school / class.</p>
        <p>2-3 times a week, students will receive a message on the app where they must respond to how they are feeling. It is a function they can press to be anonymous. If a student answers that he / she is not feeling so well, there will be a follow-up question where the student can answer whether he / she wants to talk to someone; If the student answers YES, the student will have different options (teacher, nurse, a third party that is not known) on whom he / she can talk to. Here the student can choose to be anonymous by using a chat function to talk to the person they want. If tey want to meet the person physically, it is possible to book a meeting inside the app. If the student answers NO, the app will show links / articles to pages where the student can read about what they can do if they are in a difficult place in life.</p>
        <p>The app will also have a calendar, which shows the schedule. The app registers your attendance in the different classes, in this way the students can see how they are doing in relation to the 10% rule.</p>
        <p>Teachers will also be able to see statistics based on what the students answer.</p>
